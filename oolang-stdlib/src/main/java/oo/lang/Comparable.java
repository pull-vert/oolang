	/**
	 * Compares this object with the specified object for order. Returns a
	 * negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this object is less
	 * than, equal to, or greater than the specified object.
	 *
	 * <p>The implementor must ensure
	 * {@code sgn(x.compareTo(y)) == -sgn(y.compareTo(x))}
	 * for all {@code x} and {@code y}.  (This
	 * implies that {@code x.compareTo(y)} must throw an exception iff
	 * {@code y.compareTo(x)} throws an exception.)
	 *
	 * <p>The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive:
	 * {@code (x.compareTo(y) > 0 && y.compareTo(z) > 0)} implies
	 * {@code x.compareTo(z) > 0}.
	 *
	 * <p>Finally, the implementor must ensure that {@code x.compareTo(y)==0}
	 * implies that {@code sgn(x.compareTo(z)) == sgn(y.compareTo(z))}, for
	 * all {@code z}.
	 *
	 * <p>It is strongly recommended, but <i>not</i> strictly required that
	 * {@code (x.compareTo(y)==0) == (x.equals(y))}.  Generally speaking, any
	 * class that implements the {@code Comparable} interface and violates
	 * this condition should clearly indicate this fact.  The recommended
	 * language is "Note: this class has a natural ordering that is
	 * inconsistent with equals."
	 *
	 * <p>In the foregoing description, the notation
	 * {@code sgn(}<i>expression</i>{@code )} designates the mathematical
	 * <i>signum</i> function, which is defined to return one of {@code -1},
	 * {@code 0}, or {@code 1} according to whether the value of
	 * <i>expression</i> is negative, zero, or positive, respectively.
	 *
	 * @param   o the object to be compared.
	 * @return  a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this object
	 *          is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object.
